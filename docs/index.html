        <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> February 12, 2026</p>
        <p>At SolTix, we are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use our decentralized application (dApp) for event ticketing on the Solana blockchain.</p>
        <h3>Information We Collect</h3>
        <p>We do not collect any personal information from users. SolTix operates on the blockchain, and all transactions are recorded on the Solana network. Wallet addresses and transaction data are public on the blockchain and not stored by us.</p>
        <h3>How We Use Information</h3>
        <p>Since we do not collect personal data, there is no use of such information. The dApp interacts directly with your wallet for purchasing, selling, and reselling tickets.</p>
        <h3>Data Security</h3>
        <p>Your security is paramount. We recommend using secure wallets and following best practices for blockchain interactions. We do not store sensitive information.</p>
        <h3>Changes to This Policy</h3>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page.</p>
